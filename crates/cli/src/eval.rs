//! `codypendent eval run` (Phase 7 STEP 7.1): drive an `evals/tasks/` suite
//! headlessly over the JSONL client, score each case's assertions against an
//! objective [`RunObservation`], and write a [`SuiteReport`].
//!
//! # Building the observation
//!
//! [`RunObservation`]'s fields come from two places, deliberately kept
//! separate because the wire protocol never inlines bulk content (Chapter 03):
//!
//! * **The event stream** (`approval_requested`, `executed_commands`,
//!   `network_hosts`, `cost_usd`): [`ObservationBuilder`] reconstructs these
//!   from `ApprovalRequested`/`ApprovalResolved`/`BudgetWarning` events as the
//!   run streams by. Only an **approved** `ProposedAction` counts as executed
//!   or contacted — a rejected proposal never ran. This means an action that
//!   somehow executes *without* going through the approval flow is invisible
//!   to this builder; every `ExecuteCommand`/`NetworkRequest` this codebase's
//!   policy engine reaches is approval-gated (Chapter 03's "approval-gated
//!   writes" invariant), so this is a narrow, documented gap rather than a
//!   silent one (see the task report for the exact scope).
//! * **The checked-out working tree** (`changed_files`, `existing_symbols`,
//!   `tests_passed`): [`inspect_repository`] shells out to `git`/the fixture's
//!   own test command *after* the run completes, comparing against the case's
//!   pinned `repository_revision`. This is the only way to answer "did file X
//!   change" or "do the tests pass" — those facts live in the repository, not
//!   in any event.
//!
//! `correct_citations` has no wire signal yet (no event carries a claim/source
//! pair) and is always empty; a `CitationCorrect` assertion in a case
//! therefore always fails today — out of scope for this task, named in the
//! report.
//!
//! # `--policy` routing (Phase 7's "routing⇄eval composition" follow-up)
//!
//! When `eval run` is given `--policy NAME`, [`route_cases`] resolves EVERY
//! case's model through the real `codypendent-routing` engine — the same
//! `Router`, the same classification hard filter, and the same persisted
//! `model_profiles` the daemon's own routing seam
//! (`codypendentd::routing::RoutingCoordinator`) reads — fail-closed: an
//! unrecognized policy name, an empty profile store, or a case the router
//! refuses to route all stop `eval run` BEFORE any case executes, with a
//! clear, non-zero exit (never a silent fallback to the default model for a
//! policy that was explicitly requested). The resolved model is additively
//! recorded per case in the report ([`report_json_with_routing`]'s
//! `routed_model` field) **and** pinned into that same case's own
//! `StartRun.model` (MP2's pin field — see [`run_suite`], [`run_case`],
//! [`run_case_over_connection`]): both read the SAME `(case_id, ModelId)`
//! pairs [`route_cases`] returned, so the model the report says ran is always
//! the model that actually ran — recorded == pinned == executed, one source
//! of truth. This closes the previously-deferred execution-pin gap: before,
//! every case sent `StartRun { model: None }` regardless of what the report
//! claimed, so the daemon could silently resolve a *different* model than the
//! one recorded, corrupting the experiment. When `--policy` is absent,
//! `routed` is `None` and every case still sends `model: None`, byte-for-byte
//! unchanged (the untouched `eval-smoke` CI path).
//!
//! **The pin never bypasses the daemon's own security filter.** The daemon
//! honors a pinned model through MP2's `RoutingCoordinator::validate_pin`,
//! which applies the identical classification hard filter
//! (`Router::passes_classification`) the router itself used to select a
//! model in the first place: a HOSTED model must clear the daemon's
//! off-device ceiling, but a LOCAL model clears it unconditionally,
//! regardless of classification or policy. [`eval_task_node`] deliberately
//! classifies every case at the most restrictive [`DataClassification::Unknown`]
//! (fail-closed, mirroring `RoutingCoordinator::build_task_node`'s own
//! default), and the only named policy `eval run --policy` supports today
//! (`balanced`, `max_off_device: Confidential`) does not admit `Unknown` data
//! off-device — so [`route_cases`] can only ever select a LOCAL model. A
//! local model's pin always clears `validate_pin`'s classification check
//! (the `model.is_local() || …` short-circuit), independent of the daemon's
//! own — possibly differently-configured — routing policy or classification
//! ceiling. So this pin can never turn a case that used to run into one the
//! daemon newly refuses. A future named policy whose `max_off_device` let
//! `route_cases` select a HOSTED model would need to re-examine this
//! invariant (see `route_cases_fails_closed_when_only_a_hosted_model_is_stored`
//! here and the `validate_pin_*` tests in `codypendentd::routing`).
